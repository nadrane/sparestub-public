    <div class="eligibility">
        <h3>1. Eligibility.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Minimum Age. You must be at least 18 years old to use the Site or to register for the Services.</li>
            <li>Criminal History. By requesting to use, registering to use, and/or using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have never been convicted of a felony and/or are not required to register as a sex offender with any government entity. SPARESTUB DOES NOT CURRENTLY CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SCREENINGS ON ITS MEMBERS. However, SpareStub reserves the right to conduct any criminal background check, at any time and using available public records, to confirm your compliance with this subsection. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you hereby authorize any such check.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>2. Use of Site and Service.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Ticket Marketplace: SpareStub is a ticket marketplace that allows users to buy ('Buyers') and sell ('Sellers') tickets and related passes (collectively, the 'tickets') for live events. As a marketplace, SpareStub does not own the tickets on the Site nor does it set prices for tickets. Because sellers set ticket prices, they may be higher than face value.</li>
            <li>Your Account: You must create an account to submit, sell or purchase tickets or related passes, or message another user, and you must have a valid credit card or debit card on file ('Payment Method'). SpareStub partners for payments with Stripe. You acknowledge that SpareStub/Stripe may charge your payment method for amounts you owe us, or the seller in the case of Secure payment, along with costs we incur or other losses arising out of your violation of this Agreement (including the Additional Policies).</li>
            <li>Fees: We may charge service, transaction, subscription or other fees for using our Services (collectively referred to as 'Fees'). SpareStub reserves the right in its sole discretion to change Fees at any time as it deems appropriate, including after you list your tickets. In addition, we may collect fees owed using a collection agency or other collection mechanism and you may be charged fees associated with collecting the delinquent payments. SpareStub, or the collection agency it retains, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, defaults in your account may be reflected in your credit report. If you wish to dispute the information SpareStub reported to a credit bureau, contact SpareStub. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported, contact the collection agency directly.</li>
            <li>Listing Tickets: Pricing tickets is the sole responsibility of, and at the sole discretion of, Sellers and must be done in accordance with all applicable laws. Under no circumstances may you list speculative tickets. Please refer to the <a href="{% url "sellers guide" %}">Seller's Guide</a> for other requirements when listing tickets.</li>
            <li>Commitment to Supply: By listing a ticket for sale, you are making a binding offer to sell that ticket to a Buyer who purchases the ticket for the price you have specified. If you list the ticket with a “Buy It Now” option, you agree to sell the ticket to the first buyer who commits to purchase the ticket. If you list the ticket with solely the “Request to Buy” option, you agree to sell the ticket to the user for whom you agree to sell the ticket upon buyer request and seller agreement. When a Buyer commits to “Quick Buy” or you agree to the buyer’s “Request to Buy” through our Site or Services, you are contractually bound to deliver that exact ticket for the specified price and before the start of the event. You are obligated to monitor your inventory and ensure all listings are accurate. Under no circumstances may Sellers cancel orders at one price and re-post the same tickets for a higher price. Failure to fulfill your orders will lead to charges as stated in the <a href="{% url "sellers guide" %}">Seller's Guide</a>.</li>
            <li>Taxes: You are solely responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes resulting from your ticket sales.</li>
            <li>Buying Tickets: When purchasing tickets, you are entering into a binding contract with the Seller to purchase those tickets or related passes. If you purchase a “Quick Buy” ticket, you enter into the contract immediately.  You may not Cancel a “Buy it Now” purchase. If you “Request to Buy” a ticket, you enter the contract as soon as the seller agrees to the sale. Until the seller agrees, you may Cancel your request to buy. With the “Secure” payment method, buyer transaction fee and payment are remitted to SpareStub and payment minus seller transaction fee is disbursed to the seller according to our payment policy. With the “Good Faith” payment method, payment is handled offline between the buyer and the seller, and solely the transaction fees are taken in through the SpareStub website or application. All Sales are Final. Except for canceled events, you will not receive a refund for completed purchases. You cannot change or cancel any orders after the commitment for sale is complete.</li>
            <li>Event Cancellations, Postponement, and other Event Changes:
              <ul>
                <li>Cancellation: If an event is cancelled or a contingent event (e.g. playoff game) does not occur, we will remove the relevant listings and email you about the cancellation. The Buyer will receive a full refund and the Seller will, if he received payment, be charged the amount he received for the original sale.</li>
                <li>Postponement: If an event is postponed and rescheduled, SpareStub will work with Buyers on a case-by-case basis attempting to resolve any ticket issues. Sellers cannot resell, invalidate or change the tickets for the rescheduled event. If a venue requires new tickets for rescheduled events, sellers are expected to deliver the new tickets. SpareStub reserves the right to cancel orders if new tickets are required. Refunds will not be issued for postponed events (unless they are ultimately cancelled).</li>
                <li>Other changes: SpareStub is not responsible for partial performances, or venue, date, or time changes. No refunds will be issued in these instances.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              </ul>
            <h3>8. Indemnification.</h3>

              </ul>
            <h3>9. Communication and Privacy.</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>We may use your email address to send you messages notifying you of important changes to the Services or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, please refer to our <a href="{% url "privacy policy" %}">Privacy Policy</a> to review your options.</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>10. Term and Termination.</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>This Agreement will become effective upon your acceptance of the Agreement by your use of the Site or the Services and will remain in effect in perpetuity unless terminated hereunder. Either you or SpareStub may terminate your account at any time, for any reason or no reason, without explanation, effective upon sending email or written notice to the other party. SpareStub reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate your access to any of the Services, without notice, for any reason or no reason. We also reserve the right to remove your account information or data from our Services and any other records at any time at our sole discretion. In the event your access to any of the Services is suspended due to the breach of this Agreement, you agree that all fees then paid to SpareStub by you will be nonrefundable and all outstanding or pending payments will immediately be due. You may terminate your account by following the steps in the applicable section under "Cancellations" below, or by sending a notice of cancellation to: SpareStub, Attn: Cancellations, 2588 36th St. Astoria, NY 11103, USA. Following any termination of any Registered User's use of the SpareStub Service, SpareStub reserves the right to send a notice thereof to other Registered Users which whom you have corresponded.</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>11. Cancellations.</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Cancellation At Any Time With No Refund. Except as otherwise stated in this section, you may cancel your registration or subscription to any Services at any time during the term of such registration or subscription or any renewal period by emailing Nick@sparestub.com. In such case, your subscription will terminate at the end of the subscription term for which you have paid, and you will not receive any refund for any unused days of such subscription term. If you purchase a subscription on an installation payment basis, your ability to cancel your membership as described above will be available to you only once your final installment payment has been paid.</li>
                <li>3-Day Cancellation. The user may cancel the Agreement, without any penalty or obligation, at any time prior to midnight of the third business day following the date of this Agreement, excluding Sundays and holidays. To cancel this Agreement, mail or deliver a signed and dated notice stating that you, the buyer, are canceling this Agreement, or words of similar effect. This notice under this Section shall be sent to SpareStub LLC, Attn: Cancellations, 2588 36th St. Astoria, NY 11103, USA. Please include the e-mail address associated with your SpareStub account in this notice. The day that you submit a completed subscription form will be the date of this Agreement. Any refunds under this 3-day cancellation policy will be made within 10 days after SpareStub's receipt of your cancellation notice.</li>
                <li>Cancellation As a Result of Death or Disability. If by reason of death or disability you are unable to receive all Services for which you contracted, you or your estate may elect to be relieved of the obligation to make payments for services other than those received before death or the onset of disability, except as provided in subsection (iii).</li>
                <li>If you have prepaid any amount for the Service, so much of the amount prepaid that is allocable to services that you have not received will be promptly refunded to you or your representative.</li>
                <li>"Disability" means a condition which precludes you from physically using the Service during the term of disability and the condition is verified in writing by a physician designated and remunerated by you. Written verification from the physician must be presented to SpareStub.</li>
                <li>If the physician determines that the duration of the disability will be less than six (6) months, SpareStub may extend the term of the Services contract for a period of six (6) months at no additional charge to you in lieu of cancellation.</li>
            </ul>
              <h3>12. Renewals</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>In order to provide continuous service, SpareStub automatically renews all paid subscriptions for the Services on the date such subscriptions expire. We always communicate renewal periods to you in the subscription plan page, before you finalize the purchase of your subscription, upon confirmation of purchase, and in the body of any special promotions sent to our users. By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge that your account will be subject to the above-described automatic renewals. In all cases, if you do not wish your account to renew automatically, please follow the directions set out under "Cancellation At Any Time With No Refund" above.</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>13. Arbitration</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Arbitration of Disputes. You and SpareStub agree that any disputes arising out of or related to the Site, the Services, this Agreement and/or any policies or practices of SpareStub (a “Dispute”) will be subject to FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION as set forth in this section, and may only be resolved through an individual arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. The only exceptions to this agreement to arbitrate Disputes are claims of infringement or misappropriation of SpareStub’s copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark, service mark, trade dress or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, which SpareStub may elect to have resolved by means other than arbitration. Notwithstanding the above, SpareStub is always interested in attempting to resolve any Disputes by amicable and informal means, and we encourage you to contact us before resorting to arbitration. YOU AND SPARESTUB AGREE THAT WE ARE EACH GIVING UP OUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT in connection with any Dispute, and that our rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.</li>
                <li>No Class Actions. You and SpareStub acknowledge that neither of us will bring or participate in any class action or other class proceeding in connection with any dispute with the other party. Further, neither you nor SpareStub agrees to class arbitration or any arbitration where a person brings a dispute as a representative of other person(s).</li>
                <li>Arbitration Procedure. If the parties are unable to resolve a Dispute by informal means, the arbitration of Disputes will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), a non-profit organization not affiliated with SpareStub, in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and if deemed appropriate by the arbitrator, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.</li>
                <li>Encorcement. Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
                <li>Limitation of Time Period to Commence a Dispute. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any Dispute must be filed within one (1) year after the date in which the incident giving rise to the Dispute occurred. Failure to file an arbitration claim as described above within the applicable limitations period constitutes a waiver of such claim and serves as complete bar to any claim based on any Dispute.</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>14. General Provisions.</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Right to Seek Injunction. Violation of this Agreement may cause SpareStub irreparable harm, and therefore agree that SpareStub will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including but not limited to temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security, in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that SpareStub may have for a breach of this Agreement.</li>
                <li>Miscellaneous. This Agreement, which you accept upon registration for the Services, the <a href="{% url "privacy policy" %}">Privacy Policy</a> located on the Site, and any applicable payment, renewal, additional Services terms, comprise the entire agreement between you and SpareStub regarding the use of this Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and SpareStub related to your use of this Site or Services (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of this Agreement). The FAQ's found on the Services are for informational purposes only and are not deemed to be part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the Agreement will survive termination of your registration to the Service. The failure of SpareStub to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</li>
              </ul>
